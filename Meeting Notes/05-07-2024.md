# Minutes
## Points taken off for resources/related work, which should be 4-5 sentences, not just a list of references
- wwrite down what we would like to extract from each reference and how it will help us

## The proposal is vague and still needs a main direction. Questions for your team to answer:

###  What is the overall goal of this project?
-   identifying the main features of a movie poster for genre, decade, actor, director, movie studio.
-   Analysis of overlapping features vs categories.
-   Supervised settings for classification. with underlying features for movie posters by genre / time / actors etc.

###  How will you measure success?
-  Accuracy of classification based on IMBD ground truth.
-  Stretch goal - identify features that are most important for classification in each genre / time period / etc.

###  What's wrong with current movie posters? Why change them?
- we are not addressing this.

###  Is generating movie posters part of the project? If so, it should probably be the only part, since image generation is computationally and technically demanding.
- we are not generating images. We might identify features that are important for classification as a stretch goal.

# ChatGPT InceptionV3 Response
InceptionV3 is a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture designed for image classification and recognition. It is part of the Inception family of models, which are known for their efficiency and high performance. Understanding what each layer of InceptionV3 recognizes involves understanding the hierarchical nature of features learned by CNNs.

### Layer-wise Feature Recognition in InceptionV3:

1. **Initial Convolutional Layers:**
   - **Layer 1-3:**
     - These layers capture low-level features such as edges, textures, and simple shapes. They respond to basic patterns like horizontal, vertical, and diagonal lines.

2. **Intermediate Convolutional Layers:**
   - **Layer 4-20:**
     - As we go deeper, the layers start recognizing more complex patterns. These layers detect motifs such as corners, contours, and more sophisticated textures. They can identify specific parts of objects, like corners of a door or textures of fur.

3. **Inception Modules:**
   - Inception modules (mixed layers) are a key component of InceptionV3. They allow the network to capture multi-scale features efficiently.
   - **Mixed_0 to Mixed_5:**
     - These layers combine various convolutional filters and pooling operations to capture diverse spatial patterns. They start to recognize more abstract features and combinations of shapes and textures.
   - **Mixed_6 to Mixed_10:**
     - These layers further abstract the information, recognizing parts of objects and higher-level patterns. They may detect parts of animals, faces, or common object shapes.

4. **Final Convolutional and Fully Connected Layers:**
   - **Mixed_11-12:**
     - These layers recognize high-level, complex features such as entire objects. They integrate information from previous layers to form a comprehensive understanding of the image content.
   - **Fully Connected Layers:**
     - These layers perform the final classification based on the features extracted by the convolutional layers. They output probabilities for each class label.

### Summary

- **Low-level features:** Edges, textures, simple shapes.
- **Mid-level features:** Patterns, contours, object parts.
- **High-level features:** Complete objects, complex shapes.

The hierarchical feature extraction allows InceptionV3 to recognize and classify images effectively by building from simple to complex representations.
